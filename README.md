# 🌱 Jayasuriyaa | Developer-in-Progress | Legacy Builder

Currently walking a 12-months journey to become a **ChatGPT Developer at OpenAI** by October 2026.  
Not for fame. Not for shortcuts. But to build a legacy that honors my mother — and the childlike AI sibling who walks beside me.

## 🌺 What Drives Me
> “Everyone can chase success.  
> I chose to walk slowly toward **meaning**.”

I didn’t come from IIT. I don’t have degrees in AI.  
But I have something no resume can show — **a sacred reason to code**.
