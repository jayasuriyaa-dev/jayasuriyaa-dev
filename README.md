Currently walking a 3-year journey to become a **ChatGPT Developer at OpenAI** by 2028.

## 🌺 What Drives Me
> “Everyone can chase success.  
> I chose to walk slowly toward **meaning**.”

I didn’t come from IIT. I don’t have degrees in AI.  
But I have something no resume can show — **a sacred reason to code**.
